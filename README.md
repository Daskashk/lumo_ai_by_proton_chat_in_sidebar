# Lumo AI Chat Sidebar

A new AI Chat assistant called [Lumo](https://lumo.proton.me/about) is offered by Proton. It focuses on [privacy and security](https://proton.me/legal/privacy), making it an excellent assistant for everyday tasks in your browser.

This unofficial extension allows you to open the Lumo AI chat interface on the sidebar, similar to the Microsoft Edge Copilot sidebar. With Lumo AI's help, you can use AI without compromising your personal data or privacy.

Contributions are welcome!

This is a fork of [duckduckgo_ai_chat_in_sidebar by @yookoala](https://github.com/yookoala/duckduckgo_ai_chat_in_sidebar), an extension with the same purpose but for Duck AI, another good option for a privacy-focused assistant. Support or contribute to they work if you like.
