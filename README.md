# Lumo AI Chat Sidebar

Proton provides a new AI Chat assistant named [Lumo](https://lumo.proton.me/about). Focused on privacy and security, it could be a good assistant for everyday tasks in your browser.

This extension allows you to open the Lumo AI chat interface on the sidebar. It feels much like the Microsoft Edge Copilot sidebar. And with the help of Lumo AI, you're using AI with no personal data and privacy compromise.

This is a fork of [duckduckgo_ai_chat_in_sidebar by @yookoala](https://github.com/yookoala/duckduckgo_ai_chat_in_sidebar), an extension with the same purpose but for Duck AI, another good option for a privacy-focused assistant.
