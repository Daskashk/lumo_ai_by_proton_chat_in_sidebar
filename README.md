Running DuckDuckGo AI Chat interface on a sidebar.

DuckDuckGo provides a new AI Chat server on their website. As of Nov, 2024, the
AI Chat page allow user to use:
* GPT-4o mini
* Claude 3
* Llama 3.1 70B, and
* Mixtral 8x7B
anonymously and free of charge.

This extension allow you to open the DuckDuckGo AI chat interface on the
sidebar. Feels much like the Microsoft Edge Copilot sidebar. And with the help
of DuckDuckGo, you're using AI with no personal data and privacy compromise.
